            <p>Lately ive been listening to Tyler, The Creators 2019 album Igor , I love this album its such an amazing album, my favorite track on this album has got to be the first track Igor's theme I love the intro to it and just the entire instrumental. For a while when I first started listening to Tyler I just listened to New Magic Wand but over the past year and a bit ive just fell in love with his work. I love his clotheing brand Golf I myself own only one piece sadly but would love more. I reccomened checking out Tyle's music its amazing. Thanks for reading -Jade</p>
