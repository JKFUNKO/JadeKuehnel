                <h3>3:16am</h3>
                <p>NEW TYLER IS FUCKING PEAK OMFG ITS AMAZING LIKE AMAZING JEEZS ITS SO GOOD IM STILL LISTENING AND EVERY
                    TRACK IS A BANGER LIKE EVERY SINGLE TRACK ITS SO FUCKING GOOD. <a
                    href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1jzv3jwZbt8lYfEtMjiD1R?si=zgZf6mNyTTmG4vtC4bhJdg">Don't Tap
                    the Glass</a> is such a fucking master piece so differnt from Chromakopia like alot differnt, some
                    CMIGL era in there and some older Tyler in there its so fucking good. So glad I made the bad finical
                    choice of pre ordring the vinyl, idc if my grammer is wrong lol. Only note I have is that this album
                    needs to be longer 28 minutes and 30 seconds is not enough, Just saw a comment on instagram saying "if cherry bomb and call me if you get
                    lost had a baby" I 100% agree with that like thats how it sounds, I wonder who this new character
                    is tho or maybe its not new? I saw someone saying the shirtless guy from the SORRY NOT SORRY music
                    video isnt Tyler its a new character from this album, he could be right who knows. Anyways thats all
                    this album is amazing and goodnight! </p>
                <p>I guess I never talked about Chromakopia on here weird, such a great album as well like amazing got
                    lots of great tracks on there and seeing it live even more amazing, seeing Tyler live back in March
                    was amazing. If I was writing about this when it happened it would have been easier to talk about
                    but Chromakopia was like 8 months ago now and the concert was 4 jeez its been that long crazy, that
                    concert was amazing tho like such a great show put on by Tyler he truly is an artist like truly is,
                    my dad was even amazed at it. I just wish I could here these new songs live now they are amazing

                    "Make Believe" by Mother Mother, its a good single I quite like it, in my opionion atleast from what
                    Ive heard they dont really drop bad music. The second Track is "The Giver" by Chappell Roan, Ok I dont
                    like country like at all and Im glad this is her one and done country song (we might see like one
                    more) its a good track, Chappell always makes good music, I love Chappell Roan shes an icon.
                    Anways thats new music thursday (weird not new music friday) for me I know its 1am but close

        <h2> Igor</h2>
        <article>
            <h3> Nov 11 2023</h3>
            <p>Lately ive been listening to Tyler, The Creators 2019 album Igor , I love this album its such an amazing
                album, my favorite track on this album has got to be the first track Igor's theme <br /> I love the intro
                to it and just the entire instrumental. For a while when I first started listening to Tyler I just
                listened to New Magic Wand <br /> but over the past year and a bit Ive just fell in love with his work.
                I love his clotheing brand Golf I myself own only one piece sadly but would love more. I reccomened
                checking out Tyle's music its amazing. Thanks for reading -Jade</p>
