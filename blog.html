            <p>I cant sleep so and I remembered theres two new tracks that dropped today, the first one is "Make Believe" by Mother Mother, its a good single I quite like it, in my opionion atleast from what Ive heard they dont really drop bad music. The second Track is "The Giver" by Chappell Roan, Ok I dont like country like at all and Im glad this is her one and done country song (we might see like one more) its a good track, Chappell always makes good music, I love Chappell Roan shes an icon. Anways thats new music thursday (weird not new music friday) for me I know its 1am but close enought. Goodnight -Jade  </p>

        <h2> Igor</h2>
        <article>
            <h3> Nov 11 2023</h3>
            <p>Lately ive been listening to Tyler, The Creators 2019 album Igor , I love this album its such an amazing album, my favorite track on this album has got to be the first track Igor's theme <br /> I love the intro to it and just the entire instrumental. For a while when I first started listening to Tyler I just listened to New Magic Wand <br /> but over the past year and a bit Ive just fell in love with his work. I love his clotheing brand Golf I myself own only one piece sadly but would love more. I reccomened checking out Tyle's music its amazing. Thanks for reading -Jade</p>
